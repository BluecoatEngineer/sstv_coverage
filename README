What's all this, then?
----------------------
This is a follow-on project to the SSTV decoder I wrote in Verilog.  I wrote it
for a pre-silicon verification class I took at Portland State University.  It
successfully convinced the instructor to let me use my last term project as the basis
for the "show that you know how to do verification" project he wanted.  It also
gave me an excuse to go back and make sure the SSTV decoder worked as well as I
though it did.

How's that work?
----------------
What we're doing here is using Icarus Verilog to compile both the SSTV
design and the testbenches meant to bring them through all their states.
I'm making use of the Open Verification Library (OVL) to make assertions
on what the design should or should not be doing.  The end result is a
report showing any test failures and providing coverage analysis.

Wait, we're covering what now?
------------------------------
Coverage Analysis.  It's important because it's shows exactly how
much of the design is being hit by your testbench.  Untested areas
may contain bugs and it's a good idea to shake them out while you're
still in the simulation phase.  This is the exact same concept as
coverage analysis for software, by the way.

Cool!  Let's do it!  What's the magic phrase to build everything?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You may have noticed there isn't a Makefile.  That's damn peculiar and
I don't have a good reason for it being missing.  I'll get around
to writing one (most likely with a Dockerfile to set up the env)
if anyone'll find it useful for this, but you can go ahead and just cut
and paste the steps below verbatim.

Except for this first step.  This first step you gotta do yourself:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
First download the Open Verification Library and untar to ./std_ovl:
http://accellera.org/images/downloads/standards/ovl/std_ovl_v2p8.1_Apr2014.tgz

Compile Verilog:
----------------
iverilog sstv_pixel_tb.v sstv_pixel.v -I std_ovl -o sstv_pixel_tb
iverilog sstv_vis_tb.v sstv_vis.v -I std_ovl -o sstv_vis_tb
iverilog sstv_cal_tb.v sstv_cal.v -I std_ovl -o sstv_cal_tb
iverilog -Istd_ovl sstv_tb.v sstv.v sstv_vis.v sstv_pixel.v sstv_cal.v

Generate Coverage Data:
-----------------------
covered score -I std_ovl -v sstv_vis_tb.v -v sstv_vis.v -i sstv_vis_tb.SSTV_VIS -t sstv_vis -vcd sstv_vis.vcd -o sstv_vis.cdd
covered score -I std_ovl -v sstv_cal_tb.v -v sstv_cal.v -i sstv_cal_tb.SSTV_CAL -t sstv_cal -vcd sstv_cal.vcd -o sstv_cal.cdd
covered score -I std_ovl -v sstv_pixel_tb.v -v sstv_pixel.v -i sstv_pixel_tb.SSTV_PIXEL -t sstv_pixel -vcd sstv_pixel.vcd -o sstv_pixel.cdd
covered score -I std_ovl -v sstv_tb.v -v sstv_vis.v -v sstv_pixel.v -v sstv.v -v sstv_cal.v -i sstv_tb.SSTV -t sstv -vcd sstv.vcd -o sstv.cdd

Merge Coverage Data:
--------------------
covered merge *.cdd -o sstv_merged.cdd

create Report:
--------------
covered report -d d -o sstv_merged.cov sstv_merged.cdd
